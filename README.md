# Analytic Report for the School District
##  Overview of the school district analysis
        Honor to have been chosen to analyze your data and have enjoyed working with Maria and the rest     of your staff.   Your company has been able to oversee our findings and give input on GitHub 	
    routinely.  We cleaned and eliminated unnecessary information while maintaining the 	             accuracy/integrity of your data.  Initially we were informed of the following undertakings:
    
        •  A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format
        •  An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format
        •  Tables presenting each of the following metrics:
                o  Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
                o  The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
                o  The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
                o  School performance based on the budget per student
                o  School performance based on the school size 
                o  School performance based on the type of school

          Maria notified my company with regards to the academic dishonesty occurring with math/reading       scores at the ninth-grade level at Thomas High School.  Your district has honorably wanted to           uphold the academic standards set forth.  In keeping with her request, we have analyzed the             results nulling the scores from Thomas and accessing the rest of the data.  After receiving the         data replacements, we repeated our analysis and have summarized our findings as to the affect           these changes have had overall.
